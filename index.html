      <h1> WHY I JOINED ALTSCHOOLAFRICA.......</h1>
      <p>
        I basically got enrolled into ALTSCHOOLAFRICA to get specialized knowledge on relevant skills to become a cloud
        engineer.
        In the tech space, just acquiring a degree or certificate isnt enough to get one a good job, also i joined
        ALTSCHOOLAFRICA to
        get my hands dirty with hands on project to prepare me for high paying jobs whilst in the military. <br>
        I am currently in a location where there is little or no tech practitionals, so i joined ALTSCHOOLAFRICA with
        the hope
        of getting a strong professional network and get direct mentors(instructors) i can get in touch with to boost my
        learning speed.
